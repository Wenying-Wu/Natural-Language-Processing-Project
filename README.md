### Overview:
This project is about utilizing text analysis techniques to analyze unstructured data (text) in multiple text documents, aiming at providing insights and figuring out hidden themes in these documents. As a result, grouped 42 txt files into 5 topics, and classified overall sentiment of each file. Process including:

- Data understanding and preparation including removing punctuation marks, transforming all letters to lowercase, Stemming etc.
- Exploratory data analysis including word frequency, TF-IDF, word cloud, and Bigram
- Clustering using K-mean, Hierarchical clustering, Network graph
- Latent semantic analysis such as semantic similarity, sentiment analysis
- Topic modelling utilising Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm

### Output:
#### [Written Report](https://github.com/Wenying-Wu/Natural-Language-Processing-Project/blob/main/%20The%20Anatomy%20Of%20An%20Unknown%20Corpus.pdf)

> The approach used, assumptions and supporting rationale for each stage of the CRISP-DM framework. Results and recommendations, including supporting visualisations and summary data. Evaluate the results of different techniques, giving reasons for the final approach.
